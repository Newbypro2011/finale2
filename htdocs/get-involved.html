                <h2>Volunteer in Mangrove Activities</h2>
                <p>Coastal Areas, especially the ones in Davao City needs a lot of effort in conservation due to the massive urban population density along the wetlands. This results in multiple conservation and mangrove planting efforts in the city's estuary
                    and marshlands.
                </p>
                <p>One of the major organizations that you can join is ASEZ WAo, a multinational environmental conservation group that conducts yearly mangrove planting activities in Davao City and other parts of the Philippines. You can sign up or inquire
                    at their website by clicking this link: <a href="https://asezwao.org/asez-wao-revives-mangrove-forest/">ASEZ-WAO</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another environmental organization that is based within the City of Davao is Mama Earth Foundation. Currently, they are conducting aid and funding projects to restore the mangrove forests of Davao City and in other nearby coastal areas such as Mati City,
                    Davao Oriental. You can sign up or inquire at their website by clicking this link: <a href="https://www.betterplace.org/en/organisations/44591-mama-earth-foundation">Mama Earth Foundation</a>

                <h2>Simple Actions You Can Take</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing your use of single-use plastics and disposing them in the right places. When not disposed properly, these can choke mangrove roots and harms local wildlife.
                    </li>
                    <li>Dispose any chemicals responsibly. This can be done by ensuring that your cooking oil or wastes do not reach any waterways because they might end up in the nearby Mangrove estuaries.
                    </li>
                    <li>Support non-profit organizations. You can do this by donating a small but significant amount of money to organizations that participate in mangrove restoration projects. Such of these could be found above.
                    </li>
                    <li>Protect existing mangroves. If you are an individual that lives near mangrove areas, then avoid activities that could potentially damage the mangroves. These are not cutting branches for firewood, not uprooting trees, and avoid disturbing
                        these mangroves forests.
                    </li>

                <h2>Support Conservation Programs</h2>
                <p>According to the Zoological Society of London, you can help support conservation programs in many different ways.
                </p>
                <p>Firstly, you can support conservation programs by being updated with Local Government Units (LGU's) and local environmental organizations in their clean-up activities or planting activities. Secondly, you can support low-impact mangrove
                    ecotourism by discouraging the cutting down of trees to construct tourist zones. Instead, you can participate in mangrove tours which can not only help the local population, but also protect the environment. Lastly, always stay updated
                    with events and support them through the use of social media.
